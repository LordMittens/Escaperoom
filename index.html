            <p>This is the prototype of the escaperoom. During this escaperoom you goal is to break-out of your low
                privilege through exploiting multiple different vulnerabilities. For now, only one flag has been
                implemented. This flag will contain the login info of an account called room2. Feel free to ask the
                internet for help. Have fun!</p>
